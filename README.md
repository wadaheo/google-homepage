Odin project HTML/CSS clone google project.  

This is started out as my attempt at cloning www.google.com
At the end of this project I hope to have learn basic HTML and CSS.

** I am having much trouble 'getting' this, I google'd and I am mostly copying from https://github.com/renegadeHomie/google-homepage in hopes of trying to reverse engineer, in hopes of learning.
